# Push Over

Push Over is a small game developed for one of my birthday parties. I like to make games for them just to have something more to play around with. This game allows users to connect to the game using their phones from the local network. You can then control the characters on screen.

A binary for Windows will be available once the project is finished.

### Status: Experimental

The project is currently just getting started and I'm still prototyping the game concept.
